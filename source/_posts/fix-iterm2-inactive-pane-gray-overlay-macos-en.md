**Fixing the Gray Overlay Issue in macOS iTerm2 When Inactive (Defocused)**  
If your iTerm2 shows a gray overlay when losing focus (split panes or background windows), you can fix it by adjusting or disabling the dimming effect.

**Steps:**

1. Open iTerm2 Settings (**Ctrl + ,**).
2. Go to **Appearance â†’ Dimming**.
3. You can either:

   * Decrease the **Dimming amount**, or
   * Uncheck **Dim inactive split panes** (and/or **Dim background windows**).

This will remove or reduce the gray overlay when iTerm2 is inactive.
